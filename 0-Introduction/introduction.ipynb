    "This workshop has been adapted from an [AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/predicting-customer-churn-with-amazon-machine-learning/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Losing customers is costly for any business. Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay.  In this workshop we'll use machine learning (ML) for automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction.\n",

    "---\n",
    "In this workshop we will use Gradient Boosted Trees to Predict Mobile Customer Departure.\n",

    "## The format of this workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we recommend that you follow and run the Labs in order, _this workshop was built in a way that you can skip labs or just do those that interest you the most_ (e.g. you can just run the last Lab, or just run labs 4 an 5, or lab 1 and 4, etc.). Running the labs in order help us understand the natural flow of an ML project and may make more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is only possible because we leverage the design of SageMaker where each component is independent from each other (e.g. training jobs, hosting, processing) and customers have the freedom to use those that fit better to their use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `0-Introduction` lab is the only Lab that is strictly required to setup some basic things like creating S3 buckets, installing packages, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile operators have historical records that tell them which customers ended up churning and which continued using the service. We can use this historical information to train an ML model that can predict customer churn. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model to have the model predict whether this customer will churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use is publicly available and was mentioned in [Discovering Knowledge in Data](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470908742/) by Daniel T. Larose. It is attributed by the author to the University of California Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets. The `Data sets` folder that came with this notebook contains the churn dataset.\n",

    "The dataset can be [downloaded here.](https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=resource&bcsId=11704&itemId=0470908742&resourceId=46577)\n",
